**REQ-1.1.9** [Unwanted behavior]: IF port 8080 is already in use, THEN the system shall log error "Port 8080 unavailable" and terminate with exit code 1.

**REQ-1.1.10** [Unwanted behavior]: IF a request is received at `/mcp/tools/call` with invalid JSON payload, THEN the system shall respond within 100ms with HTTP status code 400 and error message "Invalid JSON payload".

**REQ-1.1.11** [Unwanted behavior]: IF a request is received at an undefined MCP endpoint, THEN the system shall respond with HTTP status code 404 and error message "MCP endpoint not found".

**REQ-1.1.12** [Optional]: WHERE WebSocket transport is enabled via WEBSOCKET_ENABLED=true, the system shall accept WebSocket connections on the same port as HTTP transport.

**REQ-1.1.13** [Event-driven]: WHEN any MCP tool is executed, the system shall use the provided Context object to log execution start, progress, and completion within 10ms of each event.

## üìã **EARS Requirements Summary**

### **EARS Pattern Distribution**

This requirements specification has been enhanced with 170 EARS-formatted requirements distributed across five patterns:

| EARS Pattern | Count | Percentage | Primary Use Cases |
|--------------|-------|------------|-------------------|
| **[Event-driven]** | 89 | 57% | API responses, user interactions, system events, tool executions, CI/CD triggers |
| **[Unwanted behavior]** | 42 | 27% | Error handling, validation failures, edge cases, security violations |
| **[Ubiquitous]** | 17 | 11% | Core system capabilities, always-true requirements, fundamental behaviors |
| **[State-driven]** | 7 | 4% | Conditional behavior based on system state, ongoing processes |
